		<h1>thoughts + discussion</h1>
		<br>
		<h4>Cybernetics</h4>
		<p>“Where Deer Stroll Peacefully Past Computers” discusses how the pandemic has brought out the advantages and disadvantages of technology today. While aspects like algorithms and the tracking features have much to offer, they are also causing harm. It is necessary to find alternatives in order for people to take care of each other. Mindy Seu’s “The Poetry of Tools” also addresses the impact of technology, instead focusing on its limitations and how understanding them can be used to create digital poetry. There are examples of artists doing this such as Emilio Gomariz’s animations and Emmett Williams’ poetry flip book. I was also intrigued by Philippe Cao’s piece “Ritual for Empowerment” that causes the user to reflect on their micro-interactions. In “Cybernetic Serendipity,” I decided to read the chapter about computer films in the 1960s. Through an electronic microfilm recorder and a computer, films could be created with commands and programming. It was quicker and more cost-effective than a hand-animated film.</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Questions:</b> <br>
				Because many of the advances in technology are also harmful, are there any areas where we are going backwards instead of progressing? Do the benefits outweigh the costs? In what ways is the “web living”? Does using computers to create art minimize the value of creating art by hand?</i>
		</p> <br>

		<h4>Radical Digital Care</h4>
		<p>Diana Nucera, who also goes by the name “Mother Cyborg,” shared her projects around creating wireless networks in Detroit and building a more inclusive space in DJ-ing culture. She addressed digital literacy in Detroit in a way that focuses on community building, allowing people to learn how to build the networks they will use. Her work overall focuses on accessibility and how technology can support self-transformation. The Virtual Care Lab fosters a space for digital care, offering creatives a place to connect and discuss experimental projects through collaborations and weekly gatherings. Cloud 9 offers a similar kind of support and collective environment but with more emphasis on resources after the pandemic. There is not much of a collection of works and experiences in the community, but the site provides workshops and opportunities to donate.</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Questions:</b> <br>
				All of these projects include community as an aspect of digital care. Is a strong community necessary for digital care or can digital communities have harmful effects as well? What do communities online offer that can’t be accessed through in-person interactions? How else can technology be used to care for individuals and address digital literacy?</i>

		<h4>Cyberfeminism</h4>
		<p>In “Data Feminism,” I read the first chapter about how power operates. D’Ignazio and Klein start by using Serena Williams’ experience on social media during her pregnancy to examine how systems of power and privilege show up in our daily lives. They explain oppression through the matrix of domination as well the impact of dominant groups, mentioning examples like bias in AI and who these systems benefit. Mindy Seu’s “Cyberfeminism Index” holds a collection of work from the feminist space over the past 30 years. Allahyari similarly also has an archive but it explores feminism in four different layers, maintaining access to speakers of Arabic and Persian.</p>

		<h4>Indigenous Technology</h4>
		<p>The indigemoji website offers a set of Indigenous emojis that are available for use on mobile. They are based on Arrernte Country in Australia and include icons that represent the lives and language of the people. This was interesting for me since I have not seen many of these symbols before and especially made me think more about how visualizations could be specific to represent more cultures and languages. “What are the characteristics that are distinct to Indigenous technology?” almost takes the form of a poem and describes the nature, form, and benefits of Indigenous technologies. It notes that the technologies “have intrinsic value,” are created from a sense of meaning, and utilize a sensory environment.
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Questions:</b> <br>
				If the Unicode Consortium started to include emojis that didn’t demonstrate widespread usage, what problems would arise? By contrast, what are the limitations of only including widely used emojis? In what ways does Indigenous technology show up in your life, if at all?</i>
		</p> <br>

		<h4>Critical Access</h4>
		<p>The Curb Cuts podcast talks about how Ed Roberts’ experience living with polio and finding independence lead to a movement that created curb cuts. Today, the curb cut effect can be seen when individuals that aren’t disabled use such accommodations for convenience. In Christine Sun Kim’s Ted talk, she shares her relationship with sound as someone who was born deaf. Through her art, she explores the similarities between music and ASL and shows that sound is not exclusive to a hearing person. This was my second time watching this so I was still fascinated by how expressive and engaging she is. The p5.js access document states p5’s commitment to accessibility and some of the ways this shows up in the library.</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Questions:</b> <br>
				Have you noticed any areas in technology and the web that are commonly lacking accessibility? How does the curb cut effect specifically show up in the digital world? In what ways can we make our work more accessible, and are there any obstacles that prevented it from happening sooner?</i>
		</p> <br>

		<h4>?NFT?</h4>
		<p>The article from The Verge explains what NFTs are in simple language, comparing them to the experience of collecting physical art. It describes how an NFT could be really anything digital, but it’s still unique due to it offering value and some ownership unlike any digital copies that may exist. Everest Pipkin describes in detail why NFTs and cryptocurrencies cause environmental damage. I didn’t realize cryptoart and minting used up this much energy or that the marketplace was constructed to be this way. The NFT websites show NFTs that are currently listed for collection, including a variety of pieces ranging from illustrations to trading cards. </p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Questions:</b> <br>
				Do you see any benefit in buying NFTs? What role does originality play in digital art? Does having an “original” preserve value or does it encourage exclusiveness? How do NFTs affect accessibility of digital objects?</i>
		</p> <br>

		<h4>AI & Art</h4>
		<p>I looked at quite a few projects in Google’s AI experiments but spent the most time playing with Move Mirror. The experiment uses Posenet and matches you with an image of someone doing the same pose, taken from an image database. It doesn’t seem like it has much of a purpose other than being fun, but I still thought it was a nice way to make the image database interesting and interactive. Anatomy of an AI system dissects the Amazon Echo to examine the social and environmental costs and effects of AI systems, ranging from energy consumption to the structure of supply chains. In the human un(limited) exhibition, I looked at Project Alias which allows people to train their smart assistants and have more control. It helps with privacy because the assistant’s microphones are interrupted when it’s not in use so it can’t listen all the time.</p>

		<p>
			<i>
				<b>Questions:</b> <br>
				Can you think of any instances of AI where there is little to no risk around privacy and security? How doable is it? Do you use smart assistants like Siri or Alexa? Why did you choose to, or choose not to? How do you feel about the “merging” of humans with machines? At what point would we need to set a limit?</i>
